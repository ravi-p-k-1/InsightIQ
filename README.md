# InsightIQ: Economy Insight Assistant

InsightIQ: Economy Insight Assistant is a React and Node app for generating dashboard-ready economic insights from FRED data. It uses a local RAG-style retrieval pipeline to find real FRED series IDs before asking Gemini to explain the retrieved data.

The app flow is:

1. User enters an economic question.
2. Backend searches the local pgvector FRED catalog for relevant series IDs.
3. Backend fetches annual FRED observations and series units.
4. Backend asks Gemini for an overall summary and an explanation for each series.
5. Frontend renders the overall summary, charts, and the latest 10 completed queries in browser history.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/`: Vite React client with React Router and Recharts.
- `backend/`: Express API server for vector search, Gemini explanations, and FRED calls.
- `pipeline/`: Offline FRED catalog ingestion, tagging, embedding, and pgvector indexing jobs.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or newer
- Docker Desktop for the local Postgres/pgvector database
- A Gemini API key
- A FRED API key

## Backend Setup

The backend depends on the local pgvector database created by the pipeline. Run
the pipeline setup at least once before using the dashboard, otherwise vector
search will not have embedded FRED series to retrieve.

```bash
cd backend
npm.cmd install
```

Create `backend/.env` from `backend/.env.template`:

```bash
PORT=3001
FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
FRED_API_KEY=your_fred_api_key_here
DATABASE_URL=postgres://insightiq:insightiq@localhost:15432/insightiq_vector
EMBEDDING_MODEL=Xenova/bge-small-en-v1.5
```

Start the local vector database and make sure the pipeline has synced and
embedded FRED series:

```bash
cd ../pipeline
npm.cmd install
docker compose up -d
npm.cmd run db:setup
npm.cmd run db:sync:fred
npm.cmd run db:sync:fred-tags -- --limit 5000 --concurrency 12
npm.cmd run db:prepare:tagged-embeddings -- --missing-only
npm.cmd run db:embed:fred -- --tagged-only --limit 5000 --batch-size 50
npm.cmd run db:index:fred
```

For an existing database that is already synced and embedded, only
`docker compose up -d` is needed before starting the backend.

The first embedding or vector-search run downloads the configured local
embedding model, so the machine needs internet access for initial setup.

Start the backend:

```bash
cd ../backend
npm.cmd run dev
```

The backend runs at:

```txt
http://localhost:3001
```

## Frontend Setup

In a second terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm.cmd install
```

Create `frontend/.env` from `frontend/.env.template`:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
npm.cmd run dev
```

Open the local Vite URL shown in the terminal, usually:

```txt
http://localhost:5173
```

## Available Pages

- `/`: Generate a new economic insight dashboard.
- `/history`: View the latest 10 saved queries.
- `/history/:id`: View a saved query result without calling Gemini or FRED again.

History is stored in browser `localStorage`, so it is local to the user and browser.

## Backend Endpoints

### `GET /health`

Health check endpoint.

### `POST /api/series-ids`

Uses local embeddings and pgvector search over the indexed `fred_series` table.
Gemini is not used for series ID selection.

Request:

```json
{
  "query": "What is happening with inflation?"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "series": [
    {
      "seriesId": "CPIAUCSL",
      "title": "Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `POST /api/insights`

Request:

```json
{
  "query": "What is happening with inflation?",
  "series": [
    {
      "seriesId": "CPIAUCSL",
      "title": "Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers"
    }
  ]
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "query": "What is happening with inflation?",
  "summary": "Plain-English overview across the selected FRED series.",
  "series": [
    {
      "seriesId": "CPIAUCSL",
      "title": "Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers",
      "units": "Index 1982-1984=100",
      "observations": [
        {
          "date": "2024-01-01",
          "year": "2024",
          "value": 313.689
        }
      ],
      "insight": {
        "summary": "Plain-English explanation for this series.",
        "keyTakeaways": ["Short takeaway"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The backend skips FRED series IDs that do not exist. If none of the requested series can be fetched, `/api/insights` returns an error. Gemini is only used after series retrieval, so it does not invent FRED series IDs.

## Validation

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm.cmd run lint
npm.cmd run build
```

Backend syntax check:

```bash
cd ..
node --check backend/src/server.js
node --check backend/src/services/vectorFred.js
node --check backend/src/services/geminiInsights.js
```
